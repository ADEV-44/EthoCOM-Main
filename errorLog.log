i found this. it was hidden inside of a shiny box. i hope you like it. can we be friends now?

[usr98] the comms system is down?
[usr32] I-look. We haven’t gotten any new funding since 1999. We are still running freakin Windows 98.
[usr98] You got a PROBLEM with 98? 
[usr98] 98 was the BEST YEAR. and 98 is the BEST SYSTEM. remember that 3D maze thing?
[usr32] Oh god here we go again.
[usr98] I even made 71 new profiles so I could get the username with "98" in it!
[usr32] Look. The system is broke something awful. Calls are being dropped left and right. We have a queue of call requests to Ethos that is just getting longer and longer!
[usr98] It’s fine. Just add some more days to the estimated connection time. Problem solved.
[usr32] We can't keep doing that! I already bumped it twice! It looks super unprofessional!
[usr98] here, let me take care of it.
[usr32] ...
[usr32] You just added "9999 days" to the wait time?
[usr98] BAM! Problem solved.
[usr32] Ok, no. 
[usr98] what? I thought it was clever
[usr32] Putting aside just how flagrantly irresponsible that is, 
[usr32] why aren't the calls going through?
[usr98] i dunno
[usr32] Find out.

there is a lot of other things here. one of the voices talks about tubes and fish tanks and flying windows. then later on they say some more things.

[usr98] did you figure out why the comms are down?
[usr32] You mean did I find out what I asked YOU to do to get back online the only system our compaany does?
[usr98] well did you?
[usr32] ... yes.
[usr98] so what is the problem?
[usr32] The primary relay node is down in Ethos. 
[usr98] sector 1?
[usr32] Yeah.
[usr98] oh fuk
[usr32] So until we get that back online, nobody is talking to anyone.
[usr98] What do we do?
[usr32] I've managaed to make a replacement node that can go out there. Management wants their ADEV units to be able to talk again, and the phone connections need to get through. We just need to get this node out there so it can connect to the network and re-establish connections.
[usr98] ok, get the node into Ethos, comms go up, people can talky talky again. awesome. good luck!
[usr32] Oh, I'm sorry. What makes you think I am doing it?
[usr98] wut
[usr32] I had a word with management about your work ethic, and they decided that you would be an excellent candidate to get that relay out there.
[usr98] oh fuk
[usr32] Hope you kept your suit in good working order! I look forward to hearing how it goes. Expedition sets out the first of August. Management expects a full report.
[usr98] oh fuk

does this mean that new friends will be visiting? i hope so! i love new friends. i'll give you shinies if i can find them.
i love you!
